## The Prep Revival Starts Here

If you're reading this, you already get it. Preppy style isn't some relic of the '80s collecting dust in a Brooks Brothers catalog. It's alive, it's evolving, and it absolutely refuses to play by the old rules.

**Preps Not Dead** is a space for people who appreciate the classics but aren't afraid to remix them. The skull and crossed racquets aren't ironic — they're a statement. We respect the heritage. We just think it deserves a sharper edge.

## What to Expect

This blog is where we go deep on the things we care about:

- **Style** — Curated picks, brand spotlights, and seasonal lookbooks that bridge the gap between tradition and now
- **Architecture** — Mid-century modern, A-frames, and the kind of buildings that stop you in your tracks
- **Lifestyle** — Tennis culture, Americana, vintage finds, and the finer things worth chasing
- **Photography** — Visual stories from behind the lens

We'll also be sharing curated product roundups with affiliate links to the brands and pieces we genuinely stand behind. No filler, no fluff — just things we'd actually buy (and probably already have).

## The Vision

Think of this as the magazine we always wanted to read. Editorial quality. Strong point of view. Equal parts aspirational and accessible. Whether you're here for the fashion, the architecture inspo, or just a well-curated corner of the internet, you're in the right place.

Welcome to the club. Preps not dead.

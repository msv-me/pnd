      <h2>The Brand</h2>
      <p>
        Preps Not Dead is built on a simple premise: preppy style isn't dead — it just
        got more interesting. We take the classic foundations — the oxfords, the racquet
        sports, the architecture — and run them through a lens that's equal parts
        tradition and rebellion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skull and crossed racquets say it all. We respect the heritage but refuse
        to be boring about it. Think Ivy League meets CBGB. Think a perfectly pressed
        polo at a punk show. Think mid-century architecture with a modern edge.
      </p>

        the details — from curated Pinterest boards spanning architecture, Americana,

      <p>
        When not shooting or writing, you'll find him on the tennis court, hunting
        vintage finds, or cataloging mid-century gems that deserve more attention.
